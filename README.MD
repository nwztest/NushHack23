# Intro
Welcome to FORT, the all-in-one mobile platform for managing your child's/student's ADHD.

# Layout
There are three main tabs in the bottom navigation bar: Focus, Organise, and Relax. They are all rather self-explanatory.

## Focus
Pressing on the Focus tab allows one to access a myriad of games aimed at improving the child's focus. Clicking on any of the tabs allows you to enter the game mode.

### Reaction Time
The aim of this game is to press the screen as soon as a colour change appears.

### Cup Shuffle
The aim of this game is to first click on the big cup to "prepare" the other 3 cups, followed by selecting the cup that one thinks that the ball is under. Pressing the "circular arrow" restarts the cups, and the back button goes back to the focus home page.

### Card Match
I did not make this yet; pressing this opens Cup Shuffle.

## Organise
Pressing on the Organise tab allows one to come across an event organisation app. The user puts in the name of the activity, followed by the date of the event. By pressing add event, the activity is added, but only if the date input is valid.

## Relax
Chatbot features have not been made yet. Deep Breathing opens an implementation of the famous 4-7-8 breathing exercise.
